Even though I am still a Java developer at my day job, I recently started programming seriously in Scala in September 2012 when I enrolled in Martin Odersky's online course, [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun). After completing the course ([with distinction](http://adamcin.net/progfun_certificate.pdf)), I was inspired to hit the ground running by switching over to scala immediately on all my personal projects.\r\n\r\nTo get the ball rolling, I figured I'd start by recreating any incompatible link in the Java- and Maven-based toolchain that I use for development of Adobe CQ5 in order to support future development in Scala:\r\n\r\n* [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/) (generally compatible with scala, but added [scala-maven-plugin](http://davidb.github.com/scala-maven-plugin/))\r\n* [maven-bundle-plugin](http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html) (fully compatible with scala)\r\n* [maven-scr-plugin](http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-maven-scr-plugin.html) (needs to be replaced, as it is dependent on Java source files)\r\n* adept-maven-plugin (not incompatible with scala, but also not public; superseded by [vltpack-maven-plugin ](https://github.com/adamcin/vltpack-maven-plugin/) and [snagjar-maven-plugin](https://github.com/adamcin/snagjar-maven-plugin/))\r\n\r\nI intend to make all the projects I produce under this initiative available on [Sonatype's open source repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html) with generated site documentation hosted on my [adamcin GitHub profile](https://github.com/adamcin/).\r\n\r\n### Here are some links to get this party started.\r\n* [VLT Pack Maven Plugin](https://github.com/adamcin/vltpack-maven-plugin/)\r\n* [Snagjar Maven Plugin](https://github.com/adamcin/snagjar-maven-plugin/)\r\n* [Scala Mojo Maven Plugin](https://github.com/adamcin/scalamojo-maven-plugin/)","tagline":"scala, maven, and cq5 @adamcin.net"}
